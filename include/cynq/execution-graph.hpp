 * @brief Execution Graph Interface
 *
 * This interface is used to create execution graphs for asynchronous running.
 * There are several possible implementations, such as execution streams (like
 * the ones from CUDA) or graphs, where you can have nodes that depend on two
 * different tasks.
 *
 * In the future, we plan to add support for Events. In the mean time, you
 * can synchronise using the Sync(node_id) for synchronising at a certain point
 * of the execution.
 *
 * All functions and their arguments added to the ExecutionGraph must be
 * accesible all the time that the graph is active. Otherwise, it may lead to
 * catastrophic errors.
 *
 * All implementations of this abstract interface must safeguard the platform
 * independency and must no have any implementation detail.
