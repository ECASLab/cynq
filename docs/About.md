# About

CYNQ is an alternative framework to code applications for Xilinx FPGAs with the easiness of PYNQ. Currently, most of the flow is quite complex and requires Vitis to get a decent C++ application and there are no bindings from the official PYNQ. Based on these needs, CYNQ proposes:

* Provide C++ bindings for C++ applications
* Provide high performance
* Keep the simplicity of PYNQ
* Provide an agnostic interface amongst several hardware: ZYNQ, Alveo, PCIe cards

This project is completely Open Source thanks to:

* Ministero dell'Universit√† e della Ricerca
* University of Trieste
* Costa Rica Institute of Technology

Our goal is to keep it Open Source, accessible and powerful. Collaboration and improvements are very welcome.
